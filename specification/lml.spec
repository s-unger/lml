LML 0.1

Abstract
This specification defines the first pre-version of a new way of storing localized web- and multimedia content: the language markup language (LML). This version describes core elements of the language, that will help to archive the goals of the new markup language: seperate web design, content creation and translation, as well as providing a way for content sharing and teamwork.
