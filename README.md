# Language Markup Language
Changing the way translations are handled in the web.
## This problems should be adressed by LML:
* Better seperation between content and style.
    * Translators should be able to translate without knowing much about the style.
    * Content creators should be able to focus on creating content, and only define elements of style.
* Alterable Style
    * Designers should be able to change the styling of an element, change the element itself, without the need to go through all already created pages of content.
    * Moving content from one page to another in case of relaunch should be easy without keeping old design-specific tags.
## This is how it should work
LML is a new filetype only saving custom designed Element-Types, Text and Links to specific content.
